# Jarvis-Mini-python-Project
Jarvis is a Python voice assistant that opens websites (Google, YouTube, etc.) or plays music via voice commands. Say "Jarvis" to activate and give commands like "open Google" or "play [song_name]." Requires `musicLibrary` for songs. Install `speechrecognition`, `pyaudio`, and `pyttsx3` to run.
